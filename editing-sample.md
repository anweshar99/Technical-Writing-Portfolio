# Editing and Clarity Improvement Samples

## Purpose
These examples demonstrate editing for clarity, ambiguity resolution, and preservation of technical intent. Each case reflects situations where interpretation was required, not just grammatical correction.

---

## Case 1: Ambiguous System Behavior

### Original Version

The system validates the data after submission and updates the status if required, but in some cases it may not reflect immediately depending on processing and users should check again later to confirm if it has been updated properly.

### Revised Version

After submission, the system validates the data and updates its status.

In some cases, updates may not appear immediately due to processing delays.  
Users should revisit the record later to confirm that the status has been updated.

### Editorial Decisions

- Interpreted "may not reflect immediately" as a **processing delay**, not a failure  
- Separated system behavior from user instruction  
- Removed vague qualifiers such as "if required" and "properly"  
- Reduced cognitive load by breaking a multi-clause sentence into structured steps  

### Rationale

The original sentence combined validation logic, system latency, and user action into a single structure.  
The revision separates these concerns while preserving the intended meaning.

**Risk if unedited:** Users may assume the system has failed instead of understanding that the delay is expected, leading to unnecessary retries or duplicate submissions.

## Case 2: Conflicting Instructions

### Original Version

Users can edit submitted records if changes are required, but once the record is finalized it cannot be edited unless reopened by the admin, and in some cases records may still allow edits depending on status.

### Revised Version

Users can edit submitted records until the record is finalized.

After finalization, records cannot be edited unless an administrator reopens them.  
In some cases, edit access may still depend on the record status.

### Editorial Decisions

- Identified conflicting rules around edit permissions  
- Introduced a **clear sequence**: editable → finalized → reopened  
- Retained ambiguity around "depending on status" without over-specifying  

### Rationale

The original version presented overlapping conditions without hierarchy.  
The revision introduces order and structure while preserving the possibility of conditional exceptions.

**Risk if unedited:** Users may be unclear about when records can be edited, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about permissions or data loss.

## Case 3: Vague Error Handling

### Original Version

If the request fails, the system will return an error and users should retry or check the input if needed.

### Revised Version

If the request fails, the system returns an error message.

Users should verify the input data and retry the request.  
If the issue persists, further investigation may be required.

### Editorial Decisions

- Replaced vague instruction ("if needed") with actionable steps  
- Clarified sequence: verify → retry → escalate  
- Avoided introducing assumptions about error types  

### Rationale

The original instruction lacked clarity on what users should do after failure.  
The revision provides structured guidance without overstepping technical assumptions.

**Risk if unedited:** Users may not know how to respond to errors, resulting in repeated failures or incomplete task resolution.

## Summary of Approach

Across these examples, the focus was to:

- Resolve ambiguity without altering technical intent  
- Separate system behavior from user actions  
- Introduce logical structure where conditions were unclear  
- Avoid over-specifying when source intent was uncertain

## Note

These samples are representative of real-world editing scenarios where clarity, restraint, and interpretation are required simultaneously.
